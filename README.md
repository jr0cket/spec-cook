# spec-cook

A Clojure example project to learn how to start using `clojure.spec`.

The example create a relatively simple recipe and builds up a specification for that recipe structure, to ensure that all recipes used with the program are of the specified structure.

This project was inspired by the [Intro to clojure.spec at LambdaIsland](https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/clojure-spec).

## Usage

Load the project into your favourite editor and run the repl.  Then evaluate the code expression by expression to see what is happening.  The comments around each definition, specification and function describe what is going on (hopefully).
